# Rest API with Flask and Python (Learn on Udemy)
I started learning about building REST APIs with Flask and Python on Udemy, motivated by my goal of creating an affiliate website. I chose to store data on a VPS because shared hosting doesn't allow for processing by Python. My aim was to build a custom database to store extensive product details scraped from Amazon and other websites for affiliate marketing. I wanted to develop REST APIs to make this data accessible for website integration.

I enrolled in the "REST APIs with Flask and Python" course by Jose Salvatierra on Udemy. Although I began as an amateur, my technical background in Mechanical Engineering and strong coding skills helped me learn quickly. 
## With relentless effort, I achieved several milestones:

- Successfully created and managed a database.
- Stored product data effectively.
- Developed REST APIs using Flask.
- Deployed the APIs on a VPS using Nginx and Gunicorn.
- Pointed my domain to the VPS.

## Skills I learned:
- Coding Skills
- Problem-solving.
- Best practice in OOP principles.
- Understanding data relationships.
- Developing REST APIs with Flask and Python.
- Deploying APIs on a VPS.

## Challenges:
- Incomplete website development (front end pending). The website hasn't been completed until now.
- Balancing the learning curve of both front-end and back-end development.
- Managing high maintenance and operational costs.

### I deployed the Rest API on VPS with a domain, that the other accessed on their device.
